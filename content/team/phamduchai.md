Hi! My name is Hai. Currently, I'm a Research Resident at VinAI Research, specializing in **3D Computer Vision**. My research interests lie in the captivating realms of **3D Computer Vision**, especially **3D scene understanding** and **generative modeling**. My project, supervised by [PhD. Nguyen Ho Man Rang](https://rangnguyen.github.io) and [PhD. Nguyen Duc Minh Khoi](https://www.khoinguyen.org), focuses on **3D scene understanding** with minimal human supervision.

Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies in **Computer Engineering** at [HCMUT](https://hcmut.edu.vn), where I had the pleasure of working with [PhD. Nguyen Duc Dung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xV7uHJgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [PhD. Pham Hoang Anh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGPFOAYAAAAJ&hl=en).
