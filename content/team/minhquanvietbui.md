I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at VIC Lab, KAIST, under the supervision of Prof. Munchurl Kim. Before that I received my bachelor's degree from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology-VNU, working with Dr. Duc Dung Nguyen. My current research focuses on computer vision, neural rendering, and dynamic 3D world reconstruction from casually captured images and videos.
