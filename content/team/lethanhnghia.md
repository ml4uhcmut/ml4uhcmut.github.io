I have been studying at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology since September 2023, aiming to become an AI Engineer specializing in Computer Vision.

In October 2024, I joined the university's lab, where I collaborate with former classmates and my homeroom teacher to deepen my expertise.

I will conduct research for a scientific paper in the next semester.
