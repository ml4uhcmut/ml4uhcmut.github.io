- From June 2023, I work at ML4U Lab as a research student under the supervision of Dr. Nguyen Duc Duc

- My goal is to build AI applications that physically impact the real world.

- So far, I have conducted some academic and industrial projects related to Perception and Planning for robots (Self-driving Cars, mobile robots), gaining a strong foundation in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.
