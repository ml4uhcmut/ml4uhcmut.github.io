I currently study in KAIST EE as a Master student.

From March 2023, I work at Multimodal AI Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Joon Son Chung](https://mmai.io/joon/).

I am now working on TTS, audio generation, and interest in modern generative models. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at tandat.kaist@kaist.ac.kr.

In 2022, I graduated from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) - VNUHCM with a bachelorâ€™s degree of Computer Science advised by Dr. Duc Dung Nguyen.
