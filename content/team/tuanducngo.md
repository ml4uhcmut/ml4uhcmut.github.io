I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science of UMass Amherst, USA, advised by Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis and Prof. Chuang Gan. Prior to that, I was an AI Research Resident at VinAI Research. I received my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam. My research interests are in 3D computer vision and computer graphics.
