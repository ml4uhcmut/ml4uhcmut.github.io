I am a PhD student at MBZUAI, advised by [Prof. Hao Li](https://www.hao-li.com/Hao_Li/Hao_Li_-_about_me.html). I'm interested in visual content creation with deep generative models.

Previously, I was a research resident at VinAI Research, where I worked under supervision of [Dr. Anh Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ). Before that, I recieved a B.Eng. degree in Computer Science at the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology - VNUHCM where I was advised by [Prof. Duc Dung Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xV7uHJgAAAAJ).
