I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. My research interests include Visual Localization, Object and Scene Reconstruction, and Computer Vision.

My first publication was presented at The 17th Multi-Disciplinary International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, where I developed a coarse-to-fine framework for Visual Localization. I am currently exploring methods in scene reconstruction, as well as other aspects of computer vision.
