Currently, I am a Senior Applied AI Scientist at Speechify (https://speechify.com) which builds perfect human-like Text-to-Speech systems.

Previously, with more than five years of experience in the AI field, I have successfully delivered research solutions for industry applications, particularly in Computer Vision and Video Highlighting for streamers.

In April 2024, I completed my Master of Research in Computer Science at HCMUT (BKU), VNU-HCM, with a thesis on Audio Source Separation.

In the future, I will continue exploring advanced topics in Generative AI, including Text-to-Speech, Large Language Models (LLMs), and more.
